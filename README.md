# NodeTS-challenge

Pre-requisites:
- This project uses mongodb as database, if you have docker it's possible to avoid any installation, run the command ```docker run -d --name mongo-instance -v mongodata:/data -p 27017:27017 mongo```, having a volume as part of the container will allow you to reuse it every time you need it.

After downloading the repository run the command ```npm install```.  
For running and debbuging the app use the command ```npm run dev```.
